# PRODIGY_WD_02
<br>
This is a simple stopwatch web app that looks like a smartwatch.
<br>
You can start, pause, lap, and reset the stopwatch to track time.
<br>
It shows the time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
<br>
It also shows fake heart rate and oxygen level numbers that change every few seconds.
<br>
The heart rate shows values between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
<br>
The oxygen level shows values between 95% and 100%.
You can see your lap times below the watch face in a list.
<br>
The stopwatch and buttons have clear icons and nice animations.
<br>
The screen looks like a watch with a dark background and glowing numbers.
<br>
The project has three files: one for HTML, one for CSS styles, and one for JavaScript.
<br>
The JavaScript makes the stopwatch work and changes the heart rate and oxygen numbers.
You can open the project in any modern web browser to use it.
